​	your project.

​	• **Requirements Analysis or Research Methodology:** Choose one of the following sections 

​	depending on the style of the project that you have undertaken: 

​		o **Requirements Analysis**: This is required for technical projects and should be 

​		linked back to the project aim and objectives. It should provide a detailed use case 

​		scenario and suitable use case descriptions, user requirements, and MoSCoW

​		analysis of the requirements. 

​		o **Research Methodology:** This is required for research projects and should be 

​		linked back to the project aim and objectives. It should describe the research 

​		methods that will be employed in the project and the research questions that will 

​		be investigated.

​	• *Design (optional):* an initial design of software, or a sketch of the research methodology.

​	• **Evaluation Strategy:** Details of the evaluation and analysis of generated results to be 

​	conducted. For example, this can be the design of usability studies of your developed 

​	software, or the formulas and methods that you plan to use to evaluate your results. 



### *Back Matter*

​	• **References:** listing complete details of all the documents cited in the text.

​	• **Appendix: PLES:** A well-researched consideration of any Professional, Legal, Ethical, and Social

​	• **Appendices:** to include other supplementary material as appropriate, consult with your 

​	supervisor. Examples of these are the blank Consent Form, draft questionnaire (if you will 

​	involve human testers), and Project Journal.
