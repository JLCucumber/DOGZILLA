#### Characteristics of Quadruped Robots

- [Analysis and research of quadruped robot's legs: A comprehensive review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1729881419844148)
  mechanical legs provide the robots with excellent **maneuverability and versatility**
  which determine the core application performance such as job adaptability, walking speed, and load capacity
- [Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain](https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.abc5986)
  Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth.

###### Why this?



## What is terrain tasks? 

- [Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain](https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.abc5986)

  The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: **deformable terrains** such as mud and snow, **dynamic footholds** such as rubble, **overground impediments** such as thick vegetation and gushing water. 



#### Why it is important in Legged Robot field?



#### What kinds of challenges are in terrain tasks?

- 





## What are the methodologies to solve terrain tasks?

#### Type 1: Conventional Control Method

##### How Many Kinds of Control Method are used? 

##### How are They Achieved?

##### What They didn’t Achieve?

- [Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain](https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.abc5986)
  However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. 

#### Type 2: Learning-Based Method (RL)



- [Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain](https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.abc5986) ***

  Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. 



Visual-Locomotion

- [Visual-Locomotion: Learning to Walk on Complex Terrains with Vision](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NDYbXf-DvwZ)

  We train the vision policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate our approach on a variety of uneven environments such as randomly placed stepping stones, quincuncial piles, stairs, and moving platforms. 

##### How Many Kinds of Learning-Based Method are used?

##### How are They Achieved?

##### How They are Superior to Convtentional Control Methods?
