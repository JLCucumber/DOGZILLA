# Week 7

> Things to notice:
>
> - **Do coding works**. You should show your substaintial work.
>   - decompose the goal of your project - to be able to do that, you need to have some ideas
>   - do trivial demos testing robot dog’s different functions, even though they are not that relavant
>     - Because you can move them onto things you’ll really need
> - Fill the blanks in the overleaf first
>   - Aims & Objectives
>   - The literature review
>   - Requirement
> - Do organize your files
>   - Combine ./docs into ./logs
>   - Re-arrange your overleaf structure in some section
> - [Optional] Tell Benjamin how you decide to do the project.
