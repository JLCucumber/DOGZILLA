1. **Preliminarily determine the research direction**.

2. **Update project topic & description**.
  - Project Topic: Legged Robot that Traverses Challenging Terrain via Deep Reinforcement Learning
  - Project Discription: 
      Legged robots show their full potential in rough and unstructured terrain, where they are superior to wheeled and tracked platforms. Their primary advantage is that they are able to overcome large obstacles compared to their body size. However, navigating diverse terrains remains a challenging area of research. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) holds the promise of automating the acquisition of complex controllers that can map sensory inputs directly to low-level actions.

  - [LR_Learning to Walk via Deep Reinforcement Learning](DOGZILLA/Literature_Review/LR_Learning to Walk via Deep Reinforcement Learning.md) 

4. **Conduct basic tests on the robot dog**.
