# Ethical Proposal

**Purpose of Study**

The aim of this project is to conduct a series of research to make the robot dog, DOGZILLA, able to traverse challenging terrains such as grass, steps, gaps and objects based on Deep RL method.

The project utilizes a Sim-to-Real method, which first conducts training and testing of robotic systems on simulated environments and then transfer the learned policy to the real world with physical robots, saving cost and assuring safety. The training method is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning which has shown promise in training quadrupedal robots that is characterized by complex locomotion and control challenges.

During the whole project, no human subjects will be included and no personal data will be used, because all of the experiment content are about the robot and different terrain and none of them necesarily need a human participant or any human data. 



**Health and Safety Risk Assessment**

The project is mainly conducted on a physical robot dog platform, which mean conventional office equipment and environments do not satisfy the demand of project aim. 

The potential risks include: 1) running into public infrastucture or human, 2) falling over from high place, 3) damage to the robot entity and secondary risk.

To mitigate the risk of risk, the project will be conducted in outdoor, open areas (lawn or park) or indoor, robot-test-only areas. Besides, the robot dog will be tested or put on the ground or low places in case of falling over and causing damages. Furthermore, the content of experiment will be well-designed to protect the robot entity from being damaged, such as keeping the battery away from water or hot working environments, equiping the experimental site with soft anti-collision pads, and setting the system parameters such as speed within a safe range.
