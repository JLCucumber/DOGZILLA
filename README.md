# DOGZILLA

## Abstract

This project is to use the robot dog _DOGZILLA S2_ to conduct a series of experiments with the aim on overcoming challenging terrain via Reinforcement Learning.
For legged robots (four-leg one), they naturally have the advantage over wheeled or tracked platforms to surpass unstructured terrain, which might be filled with blocks, obstacles, gaps and stairs.

## Project Plan
The current plan for my project is:
1. Start-up Phase (Week0 ~ Week6)
  - Define an **accurate** research topic and keep refine it afterwards
  - Tools and platforms set-up: GitHub repository, OverLeaf, Linux & ROS ...
  - Build robots and conduct basic tests
  - LITERATURE REVIEW

2. Phase 2 (Week7 ~ End of Semester1)
  -  Literature Review, take note & weekly report
  -  Do some real actual stuffs with the robot dog
    -  For example, developing dog in simulation: 1) build environment 2) make it run ...
  -  Maintain GitHub and update OverLeaf
  -  Extra learning: Reinforcement Learning
    
3. Phase 3
  -  TODO
