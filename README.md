# DOGZILLA

## Abstract

This project is to use the robot dog _DOGZILLA S2_ to conduct a series of experiments with the aim on overcoming challenging terrain via Reinforcement Learning.
For legged robots (four-leg one), they naturally have the advantage over wheeled or tracked platforms to surpass unstructured terrain, which might be filled with blocks, obstacles, gaps and stairs.

## Project Plan
The current plan for my project is:

**Start-up**
  - Define an **accurate** research topic and keep refine it afterwards
  - Tools and platforms set-up: GitHub repository, OverLeaf, Linux & ROS ...
  - Build robots and conduct basic tests
  - LITERATURE REVIEW

Then the whole process is divided into three parts: **Literature Review, Implementation, and Writing**
